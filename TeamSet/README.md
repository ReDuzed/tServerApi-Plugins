# Team Set
Sets player team either through admin designation, or using the team join command, and then applies that team when rejoining the server, or trying to switch teams. 

```teamset.admin.set	/placeteam [name] [team], /removeteam [name]
teamset.admin.group	/teamgroups
teamset.join		/jointeam [team]
```
